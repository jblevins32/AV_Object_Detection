# Autonomous Vehicle Object Detection

The purpose of this project is to develop a custom road obstacle detection with bounding boxes CNN model and comapre it to state-of-the-art models like YOLO.

# File Structure:
- `data`: KITTI dataset
- `src`: source code
  - `yolo.py`: Implementation of YOLO
  - `custom_cnn.py`: Custom CNN
